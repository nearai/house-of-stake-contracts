# staking-contract — public API

Reference for **on-chain methods** exposed by `staking-contract` (Rust type names below match JSON **camelCase** field names from [`near-sdk`] serialization unless noted).

**Conventions**

- **`#[payable]` + “attach 1 yocto”**: method calls [`near_sdk::assert_one_yocto()`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk/latest/near_sdk/fn.assert_one_yocto.html); attach exactly **1 yoctoNEAR**.
- **Other `#[payable]`**: attach the stated NEAR (e.g. storage, lock stake).
- **Catalog auth**: mutating catalog methods assert the caller equals the staking pool’s **`get_owner_id()`** for that validator’s pool (cross-contract view), not a cached field on-chain.
- **Pause**: when `paused == true`, most mutating user paths revert (see individual methods).

---

## Storage & balances (`accounts.rs`)

| Method | Access | Deposit | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `storage_deposit` | Any | **Attach NEAR** | NEP-145 register/top-up: `account_id?: AccountId`, `registration_only?: bool`. With `registration_only=true`, only the amount needed to reach `min_storage_deposit` is retained and excess is refunded. Non-registration top-ups must satisfy retained storage for `min_storage_deposit + per_lock_storage_stake × user_lock_count + per_purchase_storage_stake × user_purchase_count`. |
| `storage_withdraw` | Account owner | **1 yocto** + optional `amount: NearToken` | NEP-145 withdraw from `available`; omitting `amount` withdraws all available storage. |
| `storage_unregister` | Account owner | **1 yocto** + optional `force: bool` | NEP-145 unregister/refund when the account has no retained per-lock, per-purchase, subscription, or active farm-position storage. `force=true` is rejected; without force the method returns `false` instead of deleting accounts that still own retained records. |

---

## Validator allowlist (`validators.rs`)

**Caller:** contract **`owner_account_id`** (from `config`), unless noted.

| Method | Deposit | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `add_validator` | **1 yocto** | Allowlist a **`validator_id`** (staking pool contract account). Fails if that validator row already exists. |
| `pause_validator` | **1 yocto** | Set validator **`ValidatorStatus::Paused`** (blocks **new** locks for that pool). |
| `remove_validator` | **1 yocto** | Mark **`Removed`** when no shares / pending stake / unstake / withdraw buckets (see contract checks). |

---

## Catalog — products & prices (`products.rs`)

All mutation entrypoints attach **1 yocto**, require contract **not paused**, validator **allowlisted**, then **`Promise`** chain: pool **`get_owner_id()`** → **`#[private]`** callback verifies `pool_owner == predecessor` of the **original** call.

**Returns:** most return **`Promise`** (async completion of catalog write).

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create_product` | `validator_id`, `name`, `description` → creates `prod_*`. |
| `edit_product` | `product_id`, `name`, `description`. |
| `archive_product` | `product_id`. |
| `unarchive_product` | `product_id` — restore **`CatalogStatus::Active`** (must currently be archived). |
| `delete_product` | `product_id` (invariants: no attached prices in use — see contract). |
| `create_price` | `product_id`, `name`, `description`, `amount` (`U128` yocto), `price_type`, `billing_period`, `lock_factor_near_months`, `metadata`. `PriceType::Farm` requires no billing period, `lock_factor_near_months == 0`, `metadata.farm_reward_rate`, and creates a linked `FarmPool`. At most one active Farm price may exist per product. For recurring variable-stake and farm prices, `metadata.max_amount` is an optional inclusive upper bound and must be `>= amount`. |
| `edit_price` | `price_id`, `name`, `description`. |
| `update_price` | `price_id`, optional `name`, optional `description`, optional `metadata`. Farm prices may update `metadata.farm_reward_rate`; the farm pool is settled with the old rate first, then the new rate applies prospectively. |
| `archive_price` | `price_id`. |
| `unarchive_price` | `price_id` — restore **`CatalogStatus::Active`** (must currently be archived). |
| `delete_price` | `price_id`. |
| `set_product_default_price` | `product_id`, **`price_id`: optional** — set or clear **`Product.default_price_id`**. **`price_id`** must refer to an **active** (unarchived) catalog price on that product; archived prices are rejected (**unarchive** first). Cleared when **`archive_product`**, **`archive_price`** (if that price was the default), or **`delete_price`**. |

---

## Locks (`lock.rs`)

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `lock` | Buyer / subscriber | **Attach NEAR** | **`PromiseOrValue<LockId>`** | **`price_id`**, **`product_id`**, **`duration_ns`** — provide exactly one of **`price_id`** or **`product_id`**. One-off prices require **`duration_ns`** (`U64`). Recurring monthly subscription prices require **`duration_ns: null`** and derive the duration from the billing period. Default price from **`Product.default_price_id`** when only **`product_id`** is set. **WASM:** shared per-epoch pipeline (**0–3**) then mint (**5a**); see [features/lazy-epoch-pipeline.md](features/lazy-epoch-pipeline.md). **Host tests:** synchronous mint (no promise chain). |

## Staking farm (`farm.rs`)

Farm rewards are non-transferable accounting units. `FarmPool.reward_rate` is micro-USD reward units per 1 NEAR-second, scaled by `FARM_REWARD_RATE_DENOM = 1_000_000_000_000`. Accumulators use `FARM_ACC_REWARD_PER_SHARE_DENOM = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000`.

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `stake` | Registered account | **Attach NEAR** | **`PromiseOrValue<FarmPosition>`** | `product_id`, optional `price_id`. Resolves the active Farm price, validates amount/min/max, runs the shared validator settlement pipeline, mints validator shares, updates `FarmPool.total_farm_shares`, and creates or aggregates the account's one live farm position for the product. |
| `unstake` | Position owner | **1 yocto** | **`Promise`** | `product_id`, optional `amount: U128`. Burns all shares when `amount` is `null`; otherwise converts requested NEAR to shares with ceiling division. Queues the same `user_pending_unstake` tranches as `unlock`; users later call `withdraw(validator_id)`. Full unstake closes the position and rolls accrued reward units into `FarmAccount`. |

## Direct payments (`payments.rs`)

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `pay` | Buyer | **Attach exact NEAR price × quantity** | `PurchaseId` | Direct one-off payment for `price_id` or a product default price. Requires prepaid storage for one additional purchase, an active one-off price with no billing period, and an active validator. Creates a `pay_*` purchase record, increments product/price usage, and accrues validator revenue. Does not create a lock or touch pool staking. |
| `withdraw_revenue` | Validator owner | **1 yocto** | `Promise` | `validator_id`. Verifies ownership through pool `get_owner_id()`, then transfers all direct-payment revenue for that validator to the validator owner. |
| `get_revenue_balance_for_validator` | Anyone | 0 | `NearToken` | `validator_id`. Returns currently withdrawable direct-payment revenue for the validator. |
| `get_purchase` | Anyone | 0 | `Purchase \| null` | `purchase_id`. Returns a direct payment purchase record. |
| `get_purchases` | Anyone | 0 | `Purchase[]` | `from_index`, `limit`. Lists direct payment purchases. |
| `get_purchases_for_account` | Anyone | 0 | `Purchase[]` | `account_id`, `from_index`, `limit`. Lists direct payment purchases by buyer. |
| `get_purchases_for_product` | Anyone | 0 | `Purchase[]` | `product_id`, `from_index`, `limit`. Lists direct payment purchases by product. |

Revenue withdrawal uses the same pool-owner callback pattern as catalog mutations: `withdraw_revenue` calls the pool `get_owner_id()`, then private `withdraw_revenue_after_get_owner` verifies the original caller, clears the validator revenue balance, and transfers the full balance.

---

## Subscriptions (`subscriptions.rs`)

Lifecycle RPCs (locking / renewal stays in **`lock`** above).

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `cancel_subscription` | Subscriber | **1 yocto** | — | **`product_id`** — set **`cancel_at_period_end`**; lock remains until **`lock.end_ns`**, then **`unlock`**. After **`end_ns`**, next **`lock`** starts a new period. |
| `resume_subscription` | Subscriber | **1 yocto** | — | **`product_id`** — clear **`cancel_at_period_end`** while **`Active`**, only before stored **`end_ns`** (current billing period). Fails after period end; use **`lock`** for a new period. Requires **`cancel_at_period_end == true`**. |
| `update_subscription` | Subscriber | **Attach delta NEAR for increases; 1 yocto otherwise** | **`PromiseOrValue<SubscriptionPlanChangeOutcome>`** | **`subscription_id`, `target_price_id`, `target_amount`** — unified plan update. Stake increases apply immediately after the same pre-user pipeline as **`lock`**; stake decreases are scheduled for the billing boundary, projected in views after `apply_ns`, and lazily committed by later mutations after validator settlement; price-only changes with unchanged stake apply immediately. |

---

## Unlock (`unlock.rs`)

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `unlock` | Lock owner | **1 yocto** | **`Promise`** | After **`block_timestamp >= lock.end_ns`**: pre-user settlement (**0–3**), then **`commit_share_exit`** (**5b**) — burns shares, queues **`pending_to_unstake`** and user tranches. Pool **`unstake`** for this exit is **not** called in the same transaction; it runs on the next **`lock`**, **`unlock`**, **`withdraw`**, or **`epoch_settle`** when the epoch slot is available. |

---

## Pool pipeline (`epoch.rs`)

Public **`epoch_stake` / `epoch_unstake` / `epoch_withdraw` / `refresh_validator_balance`** are **not** exposed. Pool work is driven by user flows below and optional **`epoch_settle`**.

**Per allowlisted pool (`validator_id` = pool contract account):**

- **`tx_status`**: **`Idle`** / **`Busy`** — one orchestrated pipeline at a time; **`Busy`** from entry until **`on_epoch_pipeline_terminal_release`** (**6**).
- **Per NEAR `epoch_height`**: at most **one** successful pool **`deposit_and_stake`** **or** **`unstake`** (or inline net-zero clear); updates **`last_settlement_epoch`**.
- **Fast path**: when **`last_settlement_epoch >= epoch_height`**, skip pool **`get_account`**, withdraw-if-ready, and net settle; jump to user tail (**4**) using cached **`total_staked_balance`**.
- **Full path**: pool **`get_account`** → optional withdraw (**2a–2c**) → **`try_epoch_stake_or_unstake`** on **existing** pending → user tail (**4**).
- **Unstake spacing**: another pool **`unstake`** requires **`validator_unstake_waiting_finished`** (`last_unstake_epoch` + **`epoch_unstake_settle_epochs`**).
- **Withdraw from pool** does **not** consume the stake/unstake epoch slot.

| Entry | `UserAction` tail | User tail |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| `lock` | `CommitLock` or `CommitRecurringSubscriptionLock` | Mint one-off lock or resolve recurring subscription lock after settlement (**5a**), then release with lock id (**6**) |
| `update_subscription` | `SubscriptionUpdate` | Update subscription lock or schedule deferred changes (**5d**), then release with outcome (**6**) |
| `stake` | `CommitFarmStake` | Farm stake after settlement (**5e**), then release with `FarmPosition` (**6**) |
| `unstake` | `FarmUnstakeQueue` | Farm share exit (**5f**), then terminal release (**6**) |
| `unlock` | `UnlockQueueUnstake` | Share exit only (**5b**), then terminal release (**6**) |
| `withdraw` (WASM) | `WithdrawUserTransfer` | Payout from claim bucket (**5c**), then terminal release (**6**) |
| `epoch_settle` | `SettleOnly` | No-op then **6** |

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `epoch_settle` | Any | **None** | **`Promise`** | **`validator_id`** — manual retry / advance pending stake or unstake; same rules as automatic flows. |

Pipeline steps and callbacks: [features/lazy-epoch-pipeline.md](features/lazy-epoch-pipeline.md).

## Private pool callbacks (`epoch.rs`, `lock.rs`, `unlock.rs`, `subscriptions.rs`)

**Not for users.** **`#[private]`** — only this contract account (promise continuations).

| Callback | Pipeline | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| `on_epoch_settlement_after_pool_account` | **1** | After pool **`get_account`**: refresh **`total_staked_balance`**, optional **2a–2c**, then **3** for the original `UserAction`. |
| `on_epoch_withdraw_transfer_done` | **2b** | Credit **`pending_to_withdraw`** after pool **`withdraw`**. |
| `on_after_pool_withdraw_maybe_settle` | **2c** | After **2b**; continues through **3** → **4** for the original `UserAction`. |
| `on_deposit_and_stake` | **3b** | Stake callback; pending queue + **`last_settlement_epoch`**. |
| `on_unstake` | **3c** | Unstake callback; **`last_unstake_epoch`**, **`last_settlement_epoch`**. |
| `on_epoch_settlement_dispatch_continue` | **4** | Fan-out to **5a** / **5b** / **5c** / **5d** / **5e** / **5f** and choose a terminal or value-returning release callback. |

| `resolve_recurring_subscription_lock_after_settle` | **5a** | Recurring subscription renewal/new-period resolution after validator settlement (`lock.rs`). |
| `resolve_unlock` | **5b** | Share exit and lock status update (`unlock.rs`). |
| `on_withdraw_user_transfer_after_settle` | **5c** | Claim from `pending_to_claim` and transfer to user (`withdraw.rs`). |
| `on_subscription_update_after_settle` | **5d** | Subscription update after settlement (`subscriptions.rs`). |
| `resolve_farm_stake` | **5e** | Farm stake mint and reward-accounting update (`farm.rs`). |
| `resolve_farm_unstake` | **5f** | Farm share exit, reward settlement, and optional account roll-up (`farm.rs`). |
| `on_epoch_pipeline_terminal_release` | **6** | Set **`tx_status`** → **`Idle`** for no-value tails. |
| `on_epoch_pipeline_release_with_lock_id` | **6** | Release **`Busy`** and return `LockId`; refunds payable lock deposit if the tail fails. |
| `on_epoch_pipeline_release_with_subscription_update_outcome` | **6** | Release **`Busy`** and return `SubscriptionPlanChangeOutcome`; refunds attached update deposit if the tail fails. |
| `on_epoch_pipeline_release_with_farm_position` | **6** | Release **`Busy`** and return `FarmPosition`; refunds attached farm stake if the tail fails. |

## Withdrawals & claims (`withdraw.rs`)

| Method | Access | Deposit | Returns | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `withdraw` | User | **1 yocto** | **`Promise`** | JSON **`{ "validator_id": <AccountId> }`** — after shared settlement, claim epoch-eligible pending-unstake tranches from **`pending_to_claim`** and transfer NEAR to the caller. Settlement may first pull pool funds into `pending_to_claim` through `pending_to_withdraw` when the pool has withdrawable funds (see [features/lazy-epoch-pipeline.md](features/lazy-epoch-pipeline.md)). |

> **Note:** An owner-only **`sweep_stranded_withdraw_bucket`**-style cleanup (when no user pending-unstake tranche liability remains for the validator but **`pending_to_withdraw > 0`**) is described in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) but **not** exposed in the current ABI.

---

## Governance (`governance.rs`)

**Caller:** **`owner_account_id`** unless noted. All attach **1 yocto**.

| Method | Description |

## Main types (contract JSON views)

- **`Config`** — [`../src/config.rs`](../src/config.rs): `owner_account_id`, `guardians`, lock/storage economics, `epoch_unstake_settle_epochs`, … **`min_lock_amount`** is the minimum attach for locks (including first delegation to an empty pool); governance may raise it but not below **`PROTOCOL_MIN_LOCK_AMOUNT_YOCTO`** (1 NEAR), enforced in `new` and `set_min_lock_amount`.
- **`Validator`** — [`../src/validators.rs`](../src/validators.rs): **`validator_id`** (pool contract account), accounting fields, pending buckets, **`tx_status`** (`Idle` \| `Busy`).
- **`Product`**, **`Price`**, **`PriceMetadata`**, **`Subscription`**, **`PendingSubscriptionUpdate`**, **`SubscriptionPlanChangeOutcome`**, **`Lock`**, **`Purchase`**, **`FarmPool`**, **`FarmPosition`**, **`FarmAccount`**, **`FarmAccountView`**, **`Account`**, **`StorageBalance`**, **`StorageBalanceBounds`** — [`../src/types.rs`](../src/types.rs), [`../src/accounts.rs`](../src/accounts.rs). **`Account`** is prepaid **`storage_deposit`** only (unlocked stake exits transfer directly to the user via **`withdraw`**).
