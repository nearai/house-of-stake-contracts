# Tests layout

## Host-side (`near_sdk::testing_env!`)

Most files here link [`staking-contract`](../../) as a library and drive [`near_sdk::testing_env!`](https://docs.rs/near-sdk) with synthetic contexts (including catalog callbacks simulated via `PromiseResult`). They do **not** deploy WASM.

On the **host** triple, `lock_for_*` uses a synchronous mint path (`not(target_arch = "wasm32")` in `lock.rs`) because `testing_env!` does not run promise chains. **WASM** builds always use the real async pipeline. Integration tests link the library **without** `cfg(test)`; they still get the host path when compiled for the host target.

## Sandbox (`near-workspaces`) + mock pool

[`sandbox_mock_pool.rs`](sandbox_mock_pool.rs), [`sandbox_epoch_settlement.rs`](sandbox_epoch_settlement.rs), [`sandbox_golden_path.rs`](sandbox_golden_path.rs), and [`sandbox_subscription_e2e.rs`](sandbox_subscription_e2e.rs) deploy **`staking_contract_test.wasm`** (test feature: mock clock) and **`mock_staking_pool_contract.wasm`**, then exercise real cross-contract calls. Shared helpers live in [`mock_pool/mod.rs`](mock_pool/mod.rs). Requires a **near-workspaces**–supported host (linux-x86 or darwin-arm) to run.

Build WASMs from repo root (`house-of-stake-contracts/`):

```bash
make staking-contract-test mock-staking-pool-contract
```

Run sandbox integration tests:

```bash
cargo test -p staking-contract --test sandbox_mock_pool
cargo test -p staking-contract --test sandbox_epoch_settlement
cargo test -p staking-contract --test sandbox_golden_path
cargo test -p staking-contract --test sandbox_subscription_e2e
```

**Golden path** (`sandbox_golden_path`): one documented flow — `lock_for_product` → `epoch_settle` → `unlock` → two settlement epochs → `withdraw(validator_id)` with NEAR received by the buyer.

**Subscriptions** (`sandbox_subscription_e2e`): `update_subscription` increase/decrease + renewal under sandbox (complements host [`subscription_lifecycle.rs`](subscription_lifecycle.rs)).

(`near-workspaces` installs a local NEAR sandbox binary; supported hosts are **linux-x86** and **darwin-arm**.)
