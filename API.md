## Voting

The voting contract supports two proposal flows that share a single `Config`,
`Proposal`, and `ProposalStatus`. Each proposal selects its flow (`Classic` or
`FastTrack`) at creation time via `ProposalFlow`. Doc comments below mark
fields/variants that only apply to one of the flows.

### Structures

```rust
/// Configuration of the voting contract. Governs both Classic and FastTrack flows.
pub struct Config {
    /// The account ID of the veNEAR contract.
    pub venear_account_id: AccountId,

    /// Account IDs that can approve / reject / slash proposals.
    pub reviewer_ids: Vec<AccountId>,

    /// Council member account IDs (can veto proposals).
    pub council_ids: Vec<AccountId>,

    /// The account ID that can upgrade the current contract and modify the config.
    pub owner_account_id: AccountId,
